                    Visual Hierarchy is the arranging of certain elements to show off 
                    their importance to the user. In the provided image, we can see 
                    that Amazon uses this particular technique with the "Add to cart" 
                    and "Buy Now" buttons. These are the main 'call to actions' on 
                    the page, which is why they have colors that are easily noticeable 
                    and distinguishable by the user.

            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
            <article>
                <h4 class="link"><a href="https://www.byui.edu/" target="_blank">BYU-Idaho</a></h4>

                    White space refers to the sections of a web page that are not occupied 
                    by any content on the screen. Just because there is empty space, does 
                    not mean that the space is being wasted. For this example, I have chosen
                    the BYU-Idaho home page, as it has white space between sections. This is 
                    done to make the page easier to understand, and so that there is a clear
                    distinction between elements on the page.

                <p class="content">
                    Fitt's Law refers to the amount of time required for a user to move
                    a pointer to its target area. For my example, I have chosen Google. It has 
                    a very simple interface, and you will not have to move your cursor or finger
                    far to press on the result you are looking for.
